                <h4>Individual Impact</h4>
                <p>In todays world, an individual does not have the ability to solve systemic issues
                    like the damage to the Colorado River on their own. However, if each individual
                    took owenership of their damage on the river, we would be in a much better place.
                    The first way that you can help protect the Colorado river is obvious.
                    You can make efforts to reduce the ammount of water that you use in areas nearby
                    the river. The Colorado river is currently used to provide water to "40 million people
                    for municipal use and supply water to irrigate nearly 5.5 million acres of land". If all
                    of these people and farmers reduced their water use even slightly, it would have a huge
                    impact on the health of the river.

                <h4>Voting on Issues</h4>
                <p> A big takeaway from this site should be that much of the legislation that has
                    protected the river in the past is ineffective. It is important that we propose
                    effective legislation to protect the river as well as to <b>vote</b> on any ballot
                    issues that pertain to the Colorado river.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back in 2020, on the Colorado ballot there was an issue title 7a. This proposed issue
                    would increase property taxes by "$1.90 per year for every $100,000 of assessed residential home value". 
                    This means if you have a $400,000 dollar home, you would pay an extra 4 dollars a year twaoards conservation 
                    efforts which is pretty insignificant for the individual.
                    and use the tax to help fund the Colorado River Water Conservation District. Thankfully, Colorado
                    voters were able to pass the issue and help protect the river. This tax hike has been used
                    to fund numerous conservation projects in Colorado. You can view some of them
                    <a href="https://www.coloradoriverdistrict.org/2021/10/six-new-community-water-projects-receive-grant-funding/">here</a>.
                    Hopfuelly you can see how effective legislation
                    has the ability to make a real difference.

                    This is an image of a fish passage on a dam. Funding from ballot measure 7a is being used to 
                    create a fish passage under an impassable section of highway i70.

                <h4>Conclusions</h4>
                <p> Thank you for viewing all of the pages of this interactive website. I hope you were able to 
                    better understand the issues that surround the Colorado River and how to help. The Colorado River
                    supports so many people and ecoystems but it is clearly in danger. It is time that we supported the
                    river in the same way that it has supported us. Anyone is able to help by taking the time to monitor
                    their individual impacts on the river and voting on policies to protect the river.
